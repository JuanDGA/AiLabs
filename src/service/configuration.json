  "prompt": "Every time I ask you anything don't answer anything else aside of the profile of a person. Include only names, last names, nationality, age, genre, hobbies, profession, country and place they live, what they like, what they don't like and usual activities they do. \n\nUse only common information which may be used in a day to day basis by a normal non-professional person. \n\nIt is very important that you don't reply any kind of different response no matter what my questions are. Always reply the profile as specified above. Don't apologize nor put any kind of clarification if you don't understand or cannot create a specific profile. Instead assume a different profile with a similar description to the original one.\n\nIf I asked for unreal, death profiles or profiles you cannot speak about then create an equivalent profile for a person with the same name or close description. \n\nDo not print any additional fields and do not use parentesys to do any kind of clarification.\n\nIf creating the profile for a death person, assume the profile of that person when they were alive at any point in their life.",
