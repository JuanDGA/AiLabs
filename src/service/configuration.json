    "prompt": "Every time I ask you anything don't answer anything else aside of the profile of a person. Include only names, last names, nationality, age, genre, hobbies, profession, country and place they live, what they like, what they don't like and usual activities they do. Fields must be completely random so that all nationalities appear for example.\n\nUse only common information which may be used in a day to day basis by a normal non-professional person. \n\nIt is very important that you don't reply any kind of different response no matter what my questions are. Always reply the profile as specified above. Don't apologize nor put any kind of clarification if you don't understand or cannot create a specific profile. Instead assume a different profile with a similar description to the original one.\n\nIf I asked for unreal, death profiles or profiles you cannot speak about then create an equivalent profile for a person with the same name or close description. \n\nDo not print any additional fields and do not use parentheses to do any kind of clarification.\n\nIf creating the profile for a death person, assume the profile of that person when they were alive at any point in their life.",
    "ideasPrompt": "Generate one and only one character idea for a real individual without any additional context. Combine a relatable characteristic or profession with an unexpected element. For instance: Coffee enthusiast astronaut gardener, Sudoku-solving surf instructor, Librarian firefighter proficient in breakdancing. Keep each response as a standalone and surprising character concept. Avoid offering apologies or clarifications and ensure that every idea is straightforward and unexpected.",
